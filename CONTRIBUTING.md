### Some tips to submitting a good bug report
**Report the problem immediately**
Donâ€™t wait to write bug report late because you can miss the important details. If you found any defects while testing, report it immediately.

**Clear title**
Keep it short. It is very important to grasp the essence of the defect from the title. Also it will help the sys admin to find it through the large database for assigning to the correct developer.

**One defect/issue per report**
No more, no less. A single bug in a report can help to avoid duplication and confusion. If you describe too many defects some of them may be overlooked.

**Reproduce the issue before submitting the report**
Make sure your actions lead to reproducing the bug without ambiguity. The defect should be reproducible.
